#### Convolution

A convolution is a process in which a function or a kernel extracts a specific pattern from given input space (may contain one or more channels). Mathematically, a convolution is a similarity function over two input functions. This can be related to kernel and input channel being input functions and output channel being a result of similarity of input channel to kernel. Meaning, a kernel looks for a specific pattern and hence same or similar patterns are extracted as a function of similarity.  In case of successive convolutions, output of one convolution is input of the next. In a sequential arrangement of convolutions, the receptive fields increase linearly if the convolution is not 1x1.
